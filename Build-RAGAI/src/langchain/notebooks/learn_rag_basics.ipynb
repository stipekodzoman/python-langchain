    "#### Accuracy with Smaller Chunks\n",
    "* **Increased Focus**: Smaller chunks of text or queries allow the system to focus on a more specific set of information. This specificity can lead to more accurate and relevant results because the system is not overwhelmed by too much or too broad information.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Processing Time\n",
    "* **Multiple Queries**: Smaller chunks might require multiple queries to cover a topic comprehensively. Each query involves a separate retrieval process, which cumulatively can take more time.\n",
    "* **Trade-off Between Depth and Breadth**: While smaller queries allow for a depth in a specific area, they might necessitate multiple rounds of retrieval to get a broad understanding, thus increasing overall processing time.\n",

    "#### System Limitations and Efficiency:\n",
